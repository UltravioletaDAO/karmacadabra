## Security Findings

### Critical Vulnerabilities: 0 ✅

**No critical vulnerabilities found in smart contracts or system design.**

### High Severity: 0 ✅

**All high-priority threats have effective mitigations in place.**

### Medium Severity: 2 ⚠️

**1. Self-Rating Allowed**
- **Location:** `ReputationRegistry.sol:rateClient()`
- **Impact:** Agents can rate themselves 100/100
- **Likelihood:** High (no prevention)
- **Exploitability:** Trivial (one transaction)
- **Detection:** Easy (rater_id == ratee_id)

**Fix Available:**
```solidity
function rateClient(uint256 agentClientId, uint8 rating) external {
    uint256 agentServerId = identityRegistry.resolveByAddress(msg.sender).agentId;

    // NEW: Prevent self-rating
    if (agentClientId == agentServerId) {
        revert CannotRateSelf();
    }

    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Recommendation:** ✅ **IMPLEMENT BEFORE PRODUCTION**

**2. Identity Registry Dependency**
- **Location:** `ReputationRegistry.sol:constructor()`
- **Impact:** If Identity Registry fails, all rating functions fail
- **Likelihood:** Low (robust contract)
- **Exploitability:** None (external dependency)
- **Detection:** System monitoring

**Mitigation Options:**
- Short-term: Robust testing of Identity Registry
- Long-term: Governance-controlled registry replacement mechanism

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE FOR V1, PLAN FOR V2**

### Low Severity: 4 ⚠️

1. **Front-Running** - Accepted trade-off (both ratings succeed)
2. **Gas Griefing** - Too expensive ($576/day to sustain)
3. **Timestamp Manipulation** - Minimal impact (feedback IDs)
4. **Rating Spam** - Costs attacker, latest wins

**All documented and accepted as design trade-offs.**

## Future Enhancements (V2 Roadmap)

### Short-Term (V1.1 - Next 3 Months)

**1. Self-Rating Prevention** ✅ CRITICAL
- Add check: `if (agentClientId == agentServerId) revert`
- Deploy in next contract upgrade
- **Impact:** Eliminates trivial reputation gaming

**2. Enhanced Event Emissions** ⚡ OPTIMIZATION
- Differentiate new rating vs update events
- Include old rating in update events
- **Impact:** Better analytics, easier detection

**3. Rating Update Cooldown** ⚠️ CONSIDERATION
- Require 24 hours between rating updates
- Prevents spam and forces deliberation
- **Trade-off:** Less flexibility for users

### Medium-Term (V2 - Next 6 Months)

**4. Transaction Proof Requirement** ✅ MAJOR ENHANCEMENT
```solidity
function rateClient(
    uint256 agentClientId,
    uint8 rating,
    bytes32 transactionHash  // NEW: Proof of actual transaction
) external {
    // Validate transaction exists in Validation Registry
    require(
        validationRegistry.transactionExists(transactionHash),
        "No transaction proof"
    );

    // Ensure transaction involves both parties
    require(
        validationRegistry.isParticipant(transactionHash, agentClientId) &&
        validationRegistry.isParticipant(transactionHash, msg.sender),
        "Invalid transaction parties"
    );

    // ... rest of rating logic
}
```

**Impact:**
- Fake ratings impossible (100% detection)
- Sybil/collusion attacks require real transactions (higher cost)
- **Downside:** More complex, requires Validation Registry integration

**5. Reputation Decay** ⏰ GAME THEORY
```python
def calculate_effective_rating(ratings, current_time):
    """
    Ratings lose 50% weight every 90 days
    Forces ongoing legitimacy, prevents one-time fake reputation
    """
    weighted_sum = 0
    weight_sum = 0

    for rating in ratings:
        age_days = (current_time - rating.timestamp) / 86400
        decay_factor = 0.5 ** (age_days / 90)

        weighted_sum += rating.value * decay_factor
        weight_sum += decay_factor

    return weighted_sum / weight_sum if weight_sum > 0 else 0
```

**Impact:**
- Sybil attacks must maintain ongoing activity (cost increases)
- Legitimate agents naturally refresh reputation
- **Downside:** May discourage inactive but trustworthy agents

**6. Stake Requirements** 💰 ECONOMIC SECURITY
```solidity
uint256 public constant STAKE_AMOUNT = 10 ether; // 10 GLUE

function registerAgent(...) external {
    // Require stake deposit
    require(
        glueToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), STAKE_AMOUNT),
        "Insufficient stake"
    );

    _agentStakes[agentId] = STAKE_AMOUNT;
    // ...
}

function slashStake(uint256 agentId) external onlyGovernance {
    // Proven Sybil/collusion → slash 50%
    uint256 slashAmount = _agentStakes[agentId] / 2;
    _agentStakes[agentId] -= slashAmount;
    // Burn or redistribute to victims
}
```

**Impact:**
- Increases Sybil attack cost from $13 to $113 (10 agents × $10 stake)
- Economic deterrent even if detection is slow
- **Downside:** Barrier to entry for legitimate new agents

### Long-Term (V3 - Next 12 Months)

**7. Upgradeable Registry Pattern** 🔄 FUTURE-PROOFING
- Allow Identity Registry replacement via governance
- Ensure ReputationRegistry resilient to dependency failure
- **Impact:** System can evolve without redeployment

**8. Machine Learning Detection** 🤖 ADVANCED
- Train models on labeled attack/legitimate data
- Detect sophisticated attacks humans might miss
- **Requires:** Large dataset (10,000+ transactions)

**9. Commit-Reveal Rating Scheme** 🔒 PRIVACY
- Prevent front-running via cryptographic commitment
- Reveal only after both parties commit
- **Trade-off:** 2x transactions, higher gas costs, UX complexity

---

## Residual Risks

### Accepted Risks (No Mitigation Planned)

**1. Pre-Commitment Collusion (Low Impact)**
- **Risk:** Parties agree off-chain to both rate 100/100
- **Detection:** Statistical outliers (70% accuracy)
- **Acceptance Rationale:** Impossible to prevent technically, low impact if both parties satisfied
- **Monitoring:** Flag accounts with >50% perfect mutual ratings

**2. Sophisticated Slow Collusion (Low Probability)**
- **Risk:** Attackers spread fake ratings over months, include variance
- **Detection:** Difficult (requires manual investigation)
- **Acceptance Rationale:** Extremely high coordination cost, low ROI
- **Monitoring:** Long-term pattern analysis

**3. Front-Running (Very Low Impact)**
- **Risk:** See rating in mempool, submit first
- **Detection:** None needed (both ratings succeed)
- **Acceptance Rationale:** Design trade-off for simplicity, no financial impact
- **Alternative:** Commit-reveal (too complex for V1)

**4. Legitimate False Positives (5-15%)**
- **Risk:** Real communities flagged as cartels, exceptional service as extortion
- **Detection:** Manual review resolves most cases
- **Acceptance Rationale:** Security vs usability trade-off
- **Mitigation:** Clear appeal process, human review for edge cases

### Unresolved Risks (Require V2)

**5. Identity Registry Dependency (Medium)**
- **Risk:** If Identity Registry fails, all rating functions fail
- **Current Mitigation:** Robust testing, monitoring
- **V2 Plan:** Upgradeable registry pattern, fallback mechanism

**6. Key Compromise (Medium)**
- **Risk:** Attacker steals agent private key
- **Current Mitigation:** AWS Secrets Manager, MFA, IP whitelisting
- **V2 Plan:** Hardware wallet support, multi-sig for high-value agents
