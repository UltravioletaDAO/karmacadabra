# Week 3: Security Analysis - Checklist

> Prove the bidirectional trust pattern is robust against gaming and attacks

**Goal:** By end of Week 3, you'll have comprehensive security analysis covering 3+ attack scenarios, mitigation strategies, and a code audit report.

**Time Budget:** 20 hours (4 hours/day × 5 days)
**Status:** Not started
**Current Date:** October 29, 2025

---

## Pre-Week 3 Verification

- [ ] Confirm Week 2 is complete (99 transactions analyzed)
- [ ] Review security lessons learned from Week 2
- [ ] Understand current contract implementation (ReputationRegistry.sol)
- [ ] Review existing on-chain data for potential vulnerabilities
- [ ] Set up security testing environment

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Output:** Clear understanding of attack surface and testing approach

---

## Day 1: Threat Modeling & Sybil Attack Analysis (4 hours)

### Morning: Threat Modeling (2 hours)

- [ ] Identify all actors in the system (buyers, sellers, validators, attackers)
- [ ] Map trust assumptions (what must be trusted, what is trustless)
- [ ] List attack vectors (Sybil, collusion, manipulation, DOS, front-running)
- [ ] Prioritize threats by likelihood × impact
- [ ] Create threat model diagram

**Files to create:**
- `contribution/week3/docs/threat-model.md`

**Threat Categories:**
1. **Identity Attacks:** Sybil, fake agents, stolen keys
2. **Economic Attacks:** Rating manipulation, extortion, collusion
3. **Technical Attacks:** Reentrancy, overflow, gas griefing
4. **Social Attacks:** Coordinated manipulation, review bombing

### Afternoon: Sybil Attack Analysis (2 hours)

**Scenario:** Attacker creates 10 fake agents to inflate reputation

- [ ] Model the attack:
  - [ ] Attacker deploys 10 new agent contracts
  - [ ] Registers all 10 in Identity Registry
  - [ ] Fake agents rate each other 100/100
  - [ ] Calculate cost: 10 × 0.01 AVAX registration + gas

- [ ] Test the attack:
  - [ ] Create script: `scripts/test_sybil_attack.py`
  - [ ] Execute 45 fake transactions (10 agents rating each other)
  - [ ] Measure: Time to execute, total cost, detection difficulty

- [ ] Analyze effectiveness:
  - [ ] Can fake agents get high reputation? (Yes, if no transaction validation)
  - [ ] How many transactions before detected? (Depends on heuristics)
  - [ ] What patterns emerge? (Circular rating, no external transactions)

- [ ] Document mitigations:
  - [ ] Transaction history validation (require actual service delivery)
  - [ ] Network graph analysis (detect isolated rating clusters)
  - [ ] Reputation decay (old ratings lose weight)
  - [ ] Stake requirements (collateral for new agents)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Threat model complete with 4+ categories
- [ ] Sybil attack simulated on testnet
- [ ] Attack cost calculated ($X for Y fake reputation)
- [ ] 3+ mitigation strategies documented

**Output:** `contribution/week3/3.1-DAY1-THREAT-MODEL-SYBIL.md`

---

## Day 2: Rating Manipulation & Collusion Analysis (4 hours)

### Morning: Rating Manipulation Analysis (2 hours)

**Scenario 1: Seller Extortion**
- [ ] Model: Seller refuses service unless buyer pre-commits to 5/5 rating
- [ ] Mitigation analysis:
  - [ ] Ratings happen AFTER service delivery (on-chain timestamp check)
  - [ ] Buyer can rate low if extorted, seller's behavior visible bidirectionally
  - [ ] Pattern detection: Seller always gets 5/5 (suspicious)

**Scenario 2: Buyer Extortion**
- [ ] Model: Buyer threatens 1/5 rating unless discount/refund
- [ ] Mitigation analysis:
  - [ ] Bidirectional ratings expose buyer bad behavior
  - [ ] Sellers can rate extortionist buyers low (visible to other sellers)
  - [ ] Economic incentive: Future sellers avoid low-rated buyers

**Scenario 3: Pre-Commitment Attack**
- [ ] Model: Parties agree to 5/5 ratings before transaction
- [ ] Mitigation: No technical solution (social contract enforcement)
- [ ] Detection: Statistical analysis (too many perfect ratings)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Create `scripts/test_manipulation.py`
- [ ] Simulate 20 extortion scenarios
- [ ] Measure detection rate with heuristics

### Afternoon: Collusion Attack Analysis (2 hours)

**Scenario:** Group of 5 agents coordinate to inflate each other's reputation

- [ ] Model the attack:
  - [ ] 5 agents form rating cartel
  - [ ] All rate each other 100/100
  - [ ] No actual transactions occur (fake ratings)
  - [ ] Calculate profit: Higher ratings → more real customers

- [ ] Test the attack:
  - [ ] Create `scripts/test_collusion.py`
  - [ ] Execute 10 fake ratings within cartel
  - [ ] Measure network graph clustering coefficient

- [ ] Analyze detection:
  - [ ] Network graph shows isolated cluster (high clustering)
  - [ ] No external ratings (only within group)
  - [ ] Temporal analysis (all ratings in short time window)

- [ ] Document mitigations:
  - [ ] Transaction validation (require payment proof)
  - [ ] Validation registry correlation (cross-check with actual services)
  - [ ] Reputation decay (inactive relationships lose weight)
  - [ ] Graph analysis (flag isolated high-rating clusters)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 3 manipulation scenarios modeled and tested
- [ ] Collusion attack simulated with 5 agents
- [ ] Detection heuristics implemented (graph analysis)
- [ ] Mitigation strategies documented for each attack

**Output:** `contribution/week3/3.2-DAY2-MANIPULATION-COLLUSION.md`

- [ ] **Reentrancy**
  - [ ] Analyze `rateClient()` for reentrancy vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Check state updates before external calls

  - [ ] Verify ratings cannot be deleted
  - [ ] Check for rating update vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Test metadata parsing for injection attacks

**Testing:**

- [ ] Create `tests/security/test_integer_safety.py`
- [ ] Create `tests/security/test_reentrancy.py`

### Afternoon: Integration Vulnerabilities (2 hours)

- [ ] **Front-Running Analysis**
  - [ ] Can attacker see rating transaction in mempool?
  - [ ] Can attacker front-run with different rating?
  - [ ] Mitigation: Commit-reveal scheme? (assess trade-offs)

- [ ] **Gas Griefing**
  - [ ] Can attacker make rating transactions expensive?
  - [ ] Can attacker DOS by filling blocks?
  - [ ] Mitigation: Gas limits, rate limiting

- [ ] **MEV Extraction**

- Verify contract addresses are correct
- Use `--dry-run` mode for testing logic first
- Check Fuji RPC is responsive

**Detection algorithms showing false positives:**

- Test with larger dataset (add more legitimate transactions)
- Document false positive rate as acceptable trade-off

**Code audit finding vulnerabilities:**
- Document severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- Implement fixes before proceeding
- Re-test after fixes
- Update contracts if necessary

**Gas costs too high for attacks:**
- Good news - attacks are expensive!
- Document as economic security measure
- Calculate break-even point for attackers

3. **Can attacks be detected automatically?**
   - Implement: Graph analysis, statistical outliers, transaction validation

4. **Are there critical vulnerabilities in the code?**
   - Audit: Access control, integer safety, reentrancy

5. **What are the residual risks?**

---

## Security Principles

**Follow these principles:**

1. **Assume adversarial environment** - All actors may be malicious
2. **Defense in depth** - Multiple layers of protection
3. **Economic security** - Make attacks unprofitable
4. **Transparency** - All ratings visible on-chain (auditability)
5. **Graceful degradation** - System works even under attack
6. **Document trade-offs** - No perfect security, acknowledge limits
