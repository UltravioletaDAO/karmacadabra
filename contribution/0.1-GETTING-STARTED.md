# Getting Started with EIP-8004 Contribution

> Quick start guide for contributing the bidirectional trust pattern to EIP-8004

**Status:** Week 0 - Setup Phase
**Next Action:** Run verification script to assess current implementation state

---

## Quick Overview

You're about to embark on a 16-week journey to formally contribute your bidirectional trust innovation to the Ethereum community. This folder contains everything you need.

## Step 0: Verify Current State

Before starting Week 1, you need to know what's already implemented.

### Run the verification script:

```bash
cd z:\ultravioleta\dao\karmacadabra
python scripts/verify_bidirectional_state.py
```

This will check:
- ✓ Is `rateClient()` implemented in ReputationRegistry.sol?
- ✓ Is `rateValidator()` implemented?
- ✓ Does base_agent.py have bidirectional rating methods?
- ✓ Are there existing tests?
- ✓ Current contract deployment status

### Expected Output:

The script will generate a report showing what exists and what needs to be built.

## Step 1: Start Week 1

Once you've verified the current state:

1. Open `week1/1.0-checklist.md`
2. Follow the tasks in order
3. Mark items complete as you go
4. Update `0.2-PROGRESS-TRACKER.md` daily

---

## Daily Workflow

**Morning (30 min):**
1. Read today's task in weekly checklist
2. Review any code/docs needed
3. Plan the implementation

**Work Session (2-3 hours):**
4. Execute the task
5. Write tests
6. Document what you did

**Evening (15 min):**
7. Update progress tracker
8. Commit changes with descriptive message
9. Prepare tomorrow's task

---

## Getting Help

**If you get stuck:**

1. **Check existing code:** Look at `erc-8004-example/` for reference implementations
2. **Review EIP-8004 spec:** https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004
3. **Search forums:** Ethereum Magicians, Stack Exchange
4. **Ask in Discord:** Ethereum R&D, Solidity channels

**Emergency contacts:**
- EIP-8004 Authors (see 0-MASTER-PLAN.md for contacts)
- Community forums (Ethereum Magicians)
