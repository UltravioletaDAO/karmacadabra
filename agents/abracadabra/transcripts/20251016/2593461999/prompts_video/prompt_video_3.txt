**Scene 3 Prompt:**

The scene opens with a full-body shot of 0xultravioleta, standing in an expansive void. Her figure is centered and vertical, the camera angled slightly upward, enhancing her commanding presence. She is adorned in a layered tunic: an ivory inner robe with snug sleeves, overlaid by a billowing, dark over-tunic in purples and blacks, flowing as if alive. A wide hood casts her face in shadow, revealing only her chin and nose, adding mystery to her serene composure.

0xultravioleta stands with arms open in a cross, slightly bent at the chest, palms facing upward as if channeling vast energies. Her delicate hands, fingers gracefully curved, suggest a mystical concentration. A broad belt cinches her waist, its loose ends fluttering like whispers in a magical breeze. Her sleeves flare gently, capturing violet reflections, while dark bracers hug her wrists, hinting at a warrior's spirit.

The atmosphere is charged with a vibrant play of colors; deep purples dominate, punctuated by electric magenta highlights and cyan accents. The inner tunic's creamy white stands in stark contrast, drawing focus to her ethereal presence. Energetic currents of light radiate from a luminous magical circle floating behind her head, casting a radiant halo. This circle, inscribed with faintly visible runes, pulsates with power, its light connecting to her hands through radiant filaments.
