**Scene 6 Prompt:**

The scene opens in the mystical void, where 0xultravioleta stands alone, centered and regal. The camera captures their full figure from a slightly upward angle, emphasizing their commanding presence. The orchestral score swells subtly, interwoven with the soft hum of digital energy.

A luminous circle of intricate runes glows behind their hooded head, casting a halo that bathes them in ethereal light. Wisps of violet mist swirl around their feet, while the dark overtunic flutters as if alive. The camera slowly zooms in, highlighting the convergence of white-blue rays from the circle to their open palms, which pulse with controlled, magical energy.

Suddenly, bursts of electric cyan illuminate the runes, casting intricate patterns in the mist. The camera tilts gently, capturing the interplay of shadow and light on 0xultravioleta's face, mostly obscured, adding to the aura of mystery. The scene concludes with a soft electronic note, as the screen fades to black, leaving a lingering sense of arcane anticipation.
