Previous scene context:
**Scene 6:**

*INT. DIGITAL ABYSS - NIGHT*

The scene opens with an extreme close-up of 0xultravioleta's eyes, a reflection of cascading code morphs into a swirling vortex of numbers. The camera pulls back sharply, revealing her surrounded by a vast, dark expanse, punctuated by floating, glowing data shards. The lighting shifts to a deep indigo, evoking a sense of isolation and impending challenge. A low, ominous hum swells as her silhouette is dwarfed by an enormous, flickering key formed from data. As she reaches out, the camera tilts upward, following her hand until it obscures the key, transitioning smoothly to the next scene.

Scene before that:
**Scene 5:**

*INT. DATA CHAMBER - NIGHT*

The scene begins with a swift lateral tracking shot across a dimly lit chamber, walls lined with flickering digital displays. The camera steadies on a holographic console, where lines of code cascade down like digital rain. A soft, mechanical tick-tock fills the air, building tension. The lighting is a cool, metallic blue, casting sharp shadows that dance rhythmically with the holographic glow. The camera cuts to an over-the-shoulder shot of 0xultravioleta, now seated at the console, her eyes reflecting the code. Her fingers hover over the interface, poised yet hesitant. As she taps a sequence, the console emits a deep, resonant chime, and the scene transitions with a rapid zoom into the digital display, pulling us into the next layer of the narrative.


Final Prompt:
**Scene 7:**

*INT. DIGITAL ABYSS - NIGHT*

The scene opens with a slow pan across the vast, dark expanse, revealing 0xultravioleta standing before the enormous key, now disintegrating into a cascade of digital particles. The camera smoothly zooms in on her face, capturing a flicker of determination in her eyes. The lighting shifts to a somber violet, casting long shadows that dance across her features. A soft, ethereal melody begins to play, underscoring her resolve. As the particles envelop her, the camera tilts upward, following their ascent into the void, seamlessly transitioning to the next scene.
