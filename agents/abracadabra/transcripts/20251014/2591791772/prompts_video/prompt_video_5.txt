**Scene 5:**

*INT. DATA CHAMBER - NIGHT*

The scene begins with a swift lateral tracking shot across a dimly lit chamber, walls lined with flickering digital displays. The camera steadies on a holographic console, where lines of code cascade down like digital rain. A soft, mechanical tick-tock fills the air, building tension. The lighting is a cool, metallic blue, casting sharp shadows that dance rhythmically with the holographic glow. The camera cuts to an over-the-shoulder shot of 0xultravioleta, now seated at the console, her eyes reflecting the code. Her fingers hover over the interface, poised yet hesitant. As she taps a sequence, the console emits a deep, resonant chime, and the scene transitions with a rapid zoom into the digital display, pulling us into the next layer of the narrative.
