**Scene 6:**

*INT. DIGITAL ABYSS - NIGHT*

The scene opens with an extreme close-up of 0xultravioleta's eyes, a reflection of cascading code morphs into a swirling vortex of numbers. The camera pulls back sharply, revealing her surrounded by a vast, dark expanse, punctuated by floating, glowing data shards. The lighting shifts to a deep indigo, evoking a sense of isolation and impending challenge. A low, ominous hum swells as her silhouette is dwarfed by an enormous, flickering key formed from data. As she reaches out, the camera tilts upward, following her hand until it obscures the key, transitioning smoothly to the next scene.
