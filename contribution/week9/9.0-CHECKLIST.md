# Week 9: Author Outreach - Checklist

**Phase:** Phase 3 - Community Outreach
**Week:** 9 of 16
**Goal:** Direct engagement with EIP-8004 authors and community feedback iteration
**Date:** October 30, 2025

---

## Overview

Week 9 focuses on direct outreach to EIP-8004 authors (Gavin John, Charles Cunningham) while continuing to monitor and respond to forum/GitHub engagement from Week 8. This parallel approach maximizes chances of meaningful dialogue.

**Key Principle:** Personal connection > passive waiting. Direct outreach often more effective than forum-only engagement.

- [ ] **Concise:** 5-minute pitch possible (10-15 slides max)
- [ ] **Evidence-backed:** Every claim cited

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Authors Don't Respond
**Probability:** Medium-High
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Send follow-up after 7 days (polite reminder)
- Engage on their GitHub activity (comment on related issues)
- Tag them in forum post (if no response after 14 days)
- Accept gracefully (they're busy, not obligated)

### Risk 2: Negative Feedback from Authors
**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** High (valuable but requires iteration)
**Mitigation:**
- Thank them for feedback
- Ask for specific technical concerns
- Iterate on specification based on input
- Document their suggestions for V2 roadmap
- View as improvement opportunity, not rejection

### Risk 3: Conflicting Feedback (Forum vs Authors)
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Document both perspectives
- Analyze trade-offs of each approach
- Ask community to weigh in (forum poll)
- Prioritize authors' input (they own base EIP)

### Risk 4: No Forum Engagement (Week 8-9 combined)
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Low (expected, not failure)
**Mitigation:**
- Continue with Week 10 developer engagement
- Focus on quality over quantity (1 thoughtful response > 10 "cool idea")
- Direct outreach (authors, developers) often more effective
- Patience (EIP process is slow, engagement happens over months)

## Success Metrics

### Week 9 Success Criteria
- [ ] Emails sent to both EIP-8004 authors
- [ ] At least 1 author responds (target, not requirement)
- [ ] All forum/GitHub questions answered within 24 hours
- [ ] Call materials prepared (ready if author requests call)
- [ ] Documentation iterated based on any feedback received

### Engagement Quality Indicators
- **Positive:**
  - Author responds with interest
  - Author requests call/meeting
  - Author provides constructive feedback
  - Forum engagement increases (author shares post)

- **Neutral:**
  - Author doesn't respond (expected, they're busy)
  - Polite decline ("interesting but not pursuing")
  - Suggestion to pursue as standalone EIP (not extension)

- **Negative:**
  - Technical objections we can't address
  - Suggestion that approach is fundamentally flawed
  - Request to stop outreach (respect immediately)

## Email Outreach Strategy

### Timing
- **Send Day 1 (Monday):** Best response rates mid-week
- **Follow-up Day 8 (if no response):** Polite reminder
- **Final follow-up Day 15 (if still no response):** Last attempt, then gracefully move on

### Personalization
- Reference specific aspects of their work on EIP-8004
- Acknowledge their contribution to Ethereum ecosystem
- Show genuine interest, not transactional ask

### Subject Line Options
1. "EIP-8004a Extension Proposal: Bidirectional Trust (Seeking Your Feedback)"
2. "Building on Your EIP-8004 Work: Mutual Accountability for Trustless Agents"
3. "Feedback Request: Bidirectional Trust Extension for EIP-8004"

**Best:** Option 2 (acknowledges their work, clear value prop)

---

## Call Preparation Strategy

### 5-Minute Pitch Structure
1. **Problem (1 min):** eBay $1.8B losses, asymmetric trust failures
2. **Solution (1 min):** Bidirectional trust (Uber/Airbnb proof)
3. **Implementation (1 min):** 4 new methods, zero breaking changes
4. **Evidence (1 min):** 99 real transactions, 91/100 security
5. **Ask (1 min):** Feedback, technical review, collaboration

### Anticipated Questions (Top 10)
1. Why not standalone EIP instead of extension?
2. How does this integrate with existing implementations?
3. What about gas costs?
4. Security concerns (Sybil, collusion)?
5. Why allow self-rating?
6. Retaliation mitigation?
7. Dispute resolution?
8. Cross-chain compatibility?
9. L2 deployment plans?
10. Timeline for V2 features?

**Responses prepared:** Week 8 Day 2 FAQ responses

## Next Week Preview: Week 10 - Developer Engagement

**Goals:**
- Post on r/ethdev (Reddit)
- Share on X/Twitter (tag @ethereum, @EthereumDenver)
- Create video walkthrough (Loom or YouTube, 5-10 minutes)
- Engage with interested developers (Discord, Telegram)

**Prerequisites:**
- Week 8 forum post published ✅
- Week 9 author outreach complete ✅
- Call materials prepared (reusable for developer engagement) ✅

---

## Notes

**Philosophy:** Direct outreach is respect, not spam. Authors created EIP-8004; asking for their input on extension is appropriate and valuable.

**Tone:** Professional, respectful, collaborative. Acknowledge their time is valuable. Offer flexibility (email feedback vs call vs no response all acceptable).

**Expectation management:** Authors may not respond (they're busy, no obligation). Focus on quality of outreach, not outcome. Even no response is data (tells us to pursue standalone EIP or different approach).

**Status:** ⏳ Week 9 in progress
