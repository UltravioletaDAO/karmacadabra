**Scene 3:**

*EXT. COSMIC LANDSCAPE - NIGHT*

The scene opens with a quick zoom-in from a cosmic sky, filled with swirling galaxies and shimmering stars, down to an isolated rocky terrain. The camera tilts down to reveal a HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE hovering above the ground, displaying cryptic data and error logs. Pulsating neon blue light flickers from the interface, casting dynamic shadows across the rocks. A soft, suspenseful synth hum underscores the tension. The camera dollies around the interface, capturing a ghostly image of the protagonistâ€™s face reflected in the hologram, eyes filled with determination. As the synth hum intensifies, the interface glitches and fades, mirroring the chaos of the protagonist's past mistakes. The scene concludes with a seamless crossfade to darkness, as the hum dissipates, leaving a lingering echo of urgency.
