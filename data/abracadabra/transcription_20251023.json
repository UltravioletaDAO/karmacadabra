      "text": "We're implementing ERC-8004 Extended, which is different from the base specification. Our version has bidirectional reputation where both buyers and sellers rate each other."

      "start": 185,
      "end": 210,

      "speaker": "host",
      "text": "Optionally, the seller can request validation from a validator agent. The validator analyzes the data and returns quality scores."
