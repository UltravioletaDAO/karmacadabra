### Week 2 Retrospective
**Completed:** October 29, 2025
**Hours Logged:** 10 hours (planned: 20 hours, efficiency: 2.0x)

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Self-contained contribution structure with all dependencies

- ✅ Comprehensive data analysis with 4 visualization sets
- ✅ 5 detailed case studies from real transaction data
- ✅ 15 lessons learned documented across 4 categories
- ✅ 7 daily summary documents
- ✅ Complete evidence package for EIP contribution

**Key Findings:**
- **Rating asymmetry:** Buyers rated 6.72 points higher than sellers (unexpected bias)
- **Gas efficiency:** 4x variance (21,557 for validators vs 88,810 for bidirectional)
- **Network structure:** 47 agents, 78 edges, karma-hello most popular (23 tx)
- **Throughput:** 13.12 tx/min sustained, 787 tx/hour capacity
- **Economic viability:** Profitable at 1 GLUE ≥ $0.044 USD

**Challenges:**

- Windows CMD Unicode encoding (migrated to WSL)
- Validator agent not configured (deferred to Week 3)

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Technical:** Self-contained architecture, simulation-first, WSL for data analysis
- **Data Science:** Real data reveals patterns invisible in theory, visualization-first analysis
- **Process:** Granular documentation, phased execution, efficiency from pattern replication
- **Strategic:** Over-delivery on evidence, community context matters

**What Worked:**
- Phased rollout (dry-run → 20 tx → 99 tx) prevented failures
- Daily documentation enabled rapid context switching
- NetworkX revealed network structure insights
- WSL solved encoding issues elegantly

**What Didn't Work:**
- Initial plan to deploy to all 53 agents (deferred for self-contained approach)

- Sybil attack simulations
- Rating manipulation detection
- Gas optimization based on validator pattern
