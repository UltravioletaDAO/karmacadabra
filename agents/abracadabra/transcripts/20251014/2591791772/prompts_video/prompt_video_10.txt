**Scene 10:**

*INT. DIGITAL ABYSS - NIGHT*

The camera pans down from the apex of the shimmering archway, aligning with 0xultravioleta's silhouette. Her hand reaches out, brushing through the digital particles, sending ripples of light cascading outward. As the camera dollies backwards, the particles rearrange, forming ethereal, tear-shaped droplets that float gently around her. A soft, ambient hum underscores the scene, mingling with the fading piano melody. The lighting shifts subtly, casting a warm, golden hue, symbolizing release and healing. The scene closes with a close-up of 0xultravioleta's serene face, her eyes glistening with newfound clarity.
