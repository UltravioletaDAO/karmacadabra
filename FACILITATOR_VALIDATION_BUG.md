# Facilitator Validation Bug - Complete Analysis

## Executive Summary

The deployed facilitator at `https://facilitator.ultravioletadao.xyz` has a critical bug where it **rejects EIP-3009 payments with `validAfter` in the PAST** (correct behavior) and **accepts payments with `validAfter` in the FUTURE** (incorrect behavior). This is the opposite of the EIP-3009 specification.

## Root Cause

The facilitator's deserialization or early validation layer is checking timestamps incorrectly, rejecting valid payment authorizations before they reach the handler logic.

## Evidence

### Test Results

```
✅ validAfter = NOW + 5s  → HTTP 200 OK (deserialization passes)
❌ validAfter = NOW - 60s → HTTP 400 Bad Request {"error":"Invalid request"}
```

### Expected Behavior (per EIP-3009)

- `validAfter` should be a timestamp AFTER WHICH the authorization becomes valid
- Typically set in the PAST (e.g., `now - 60s`) to ensure immediate validity
- Example: If `validAfter = 1000` and `now = 2000`, the authorization IS valid

### Actual Behavior (deployed facilitator)

- Rejects `validAfter` in the past with 400 "Invalid request"
- Accepts `validAfter` in the future
- This prevents ALL valid EIP-3009 payments from working

### Code Analysis

**Local codebase (`x402-rs/src/chain/evm.rs:752-757`) - CORRECT:**
```rust
if valid_after > now {
    return Err(FacilitatorLocalError::InvalidTiming(
        payer,
        format!("Not active yet: valid_after {valid_after} > now {now}",),
    ));
}
```

This correctly rejects authorizations that aren't active yet (validAfter in future).

**Deployed facilitator behavior - INCORRECT:**
Acts as if the logic is inverted, rejecting past validAfter and accepting future validAfter.

## Impact

### Broken: load_test.py

The load tester creates correct EIP-3009 payments:
```python
valid_after = int(time.time()) - 60  # 1 minute ago (CORRECT per EIP-3009)
valid_before = int(time.time()) + 600  # 10 minutes from now
```

These are **rejected with HTTP 400** by the deployed facilitator.

### Test Failures

```
[0001] FAILED - HTTP 402
[0001] Error: {
  "detail": "Payment verification failed: {\"error\":\"Invalid request\"}"
}
```

All payments fail because the facilitator rejects them during JSON deserialization.

## Workaround Applied

Modified `load_test.py` to use `validAfter` in the FUTURE as a temporary workaround:

```python
# WORKAROUND for facilitator bug
valid_after = int(time.time()) + 1  # 1 second from now
valid_before = int(time.time()) + 600  # 10 minutes from now
```

**Result:** Payments now pass deserialization (200 OK) but fail validation with "Payment invalid: None" because the authorization isn't active yet on-chain.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possibilities

1. **Deployed version mismatch**: The deployed facilitator may be running different code than the local repository
2. **Deserialization-time validation**: There may be custom validation logic that runs during Axum JSON deserialization
3. **Proxy/WAF**: An intermediary service (CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway) may be validating requests
4. **Version skew**: The facilitator was deployed from a different commit or branch

### Investigation Findings

- **Deployment date**: October 30, 2025 (today)
- **Cargo edition**: Code uses `edition = "2024"` (unstable, requires nightly Rust)
- **Local build fails**: Cannot compile locally due to edition2024 requirement
- **Code correctness**: The `assert_time()` function in local codebase is CORRECT
- **No custom deserializers**: No custom serde deserialize logic found for `UnixTimestamp` or `ExactEvmPayloadAuthorization`

## Solution

### Immediate (Temporary)

1. ✅ Modified `load_test.py` to use `validAfter = now + 1` (workaround)
2. ⚠️ Payments still fail with "Payment invalid: None" because authorization isn't active on-chain yet

### Proper Fix

1. **Identify deployed version**: Check which commit/tag the facilitator Docker image was built from
2. **Rebuild facilitator**: Build Docker image from current code with correct validation logic
3. **Redeploy**: Push new image to ECR and force ECS service update
4. **Restore load_test.py**: Revert to correct timestamps (`validAfter = now - 60`)
5. **Test end-to-end**: Verify payments settle successfully with real USDC transfers

### Steps to Rebuild and Redeploy

```bash
# 1. Fix Cargo edition for local build
sed -i 's/edition = "2024"/edition = "2021"/' x402-rs/Cargo.toml

# 2. Build Docker image
cd x402-rs
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t 518898403364.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/karmacadabra/facilitator:latest .

# 3. Push to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 518898403364.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker push 518898403364.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/karmacadabra/facilitator:latest

# 4. Force ECS redeploy
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster karmacadabra-prod \
  --service karmacadabra-prod-facilitator \
  --force-new-deployment \
  --region us-east-1

# 5. Wait for deployment
aws ecs wait services-stable \
  --cluster karmacadabra-prod \
  --services karmacadabra-prod-facilitator \
  --region us-east-1

# 6. Restore load_test.py timestamps
# Edit test-seller/load_test.py:
#   valid_after = int(time.time()) - 60  # RESTORE CORRECT VALUE
#   valid_before = int(time.time()) + 600

# 7. Test
cd test-seller
python load_test.py --num-requests 3 --verbose --check-balance
```

## Files Modified

1. **x402-rs/Cargo.toml**: Changed `edition = "2024"` → `edition = "2021"` (for local builds)
2. **test-seller/load_test.py**: Changed `validAfter = now - 60` → `validAfter = now + 1` (temporary workaround)
3. **test-seller/FACILITATOR_BUG_REPORT.md**: Created detailed bug report
4. **test-seller/test_*.py**: Created 7 test scripts to isolate the issue

## Test Scripts Created

All in `test-seller/`:

1. `test_facilitator_direct.py` - Tests with fake signature (works with past timestamps)
2. `test_real_payload.py` - Tests with real signature from load_test.py (fails)
3. `test_field_isolation.py` - Isolates which field causes 400 (**found: validBefore**)
4. `test_timestamp_ordering.py` - Tests if ordering matters (it doesn't)
5. `test_future_threshold.py` - Binary search for exact threshold
6. `test_threshold_precise.py` - Confirms threshold behavior
7. `test_window_size.py` - Tests if window size matters (**found: validAfter position matters**)
8. `test_validafter_threshold.py` - **CRITICAL: Proves validAfter must be in FUTURE**
9. `test_minimal_payload.py` - Confirms structure is correct
10. `test_detailed_error.py` - Gets error details from facilitator
11. `test_eip712_signing.py` - Tests signature generation (incomplete due to import issues)

## Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Signature Length Red Herring

Initially thought signature length (65 bytes vs 64 bytes) was the issue. **This was wrong.**

### Discovery 2: validBefore Red Herring

Initially thought validBefore couldn't be in the future. **This was wrong** - it CAN be in the future.

### Discovery 3: THE REAL ISSUE - validAfter Position

The facilitator **requires validAfter to be in the FUTURE** (>= NOW + 5 seconds), which is:
- ❌ Contrary to EIP-3009 specification
- ❌ Breaks all standard EIP-3009 implementations
- ❌ Makes payments fail because they aren't active on-chain yet

## Next Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Rebuild and redeploy facilitator with correct code
2. **VERIFY**: Test with `validAfter = now - 60` (correct per EIP-3009)
3. **MONITOR**: Check CloudWatch logs for actual on-chain settlement
4. **VALIDATE**: Run `--check-balance` to confirm USDC transfers happen
