[0:00 - 0:01] **Immediate Cut**: Transition from the glowing code to a dimly lit control room filled with flickering monitors. The camera glides smoothly from left to right, capturing a row of screens displaying chaotic graphs and warning alerts, a stark contrast to the previous sceneâ€™s calm.

[0:01 - 0:03] **Close-Up and Sound**: The camera zooms in on a central monitor showing a red alert, pulsating dangerously. A tense, rapid digital beep syncs with each pulse, heightening urgency.
