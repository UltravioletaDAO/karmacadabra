**Scene 4 Prompt:**

The scene opens with a full-body shot of 0xultravioleta in the void, her figure towering as the camera tilts upward. She stands centered and vertical, arms outstretched in a cross, channeling energy. Her layered tunic swirls dramatically, the dark over-tunic undulating like a living shadow against the creamy white underlayer. A wide hood veils her face, revealing only hints of chin and nose in shadowed mystery.

A glowing magical circle floats behind her head, casting a radiant halo. Inscribed with runes, it pulses with energy, sending crackling filaments to her uplifted palms. The atmosphere hums with deep purples, vibrant magenta, and electric cyan, casting ethereal reflections on her flaring sleeves and dark bracers. A misty, violet-tinged fog swirls around her, intertwining with beams of light that converge at her hands.

As the scene unfolds, a crescendo of mystical chimes and soft, pulsing electronic beats accentuates the ritualistic ambiance. The camera slowly zooms in, capturing the intricate dance of light and shadow, as the ethereal mist thickens, enveloping her in a mystical embrace. The scene fades to black, leaving a lingering aura of arcane power.
