**Scene 5:**

**INT. MYSTICAL VOID - NIGHT**

The scene opens with a full-body shot of 0xultravioleta, centered and towering in a vertical frame. The camera adopts a slightly upward perspective, emphasizing her commanding presence. Her arms stretch outward, palms up, channeling a surge of mystical energy. The dark, undulating layers of her robe float as if alive, the deep purples and blacks contrasting with the bright, ethereal glow of the magic circle hovering behind her head. This circle emits a luminous halo, inscribed with barely legible runes that pulse with power.

Ray-like tendrils of bluish-white light extend from the circle, converging into her open palms, creating a mesmerizing dance of energy. A volumetric violet mist swirls around her feet, revealing a glowing pattern beneath. The camera gently pans upward, capturing the enigmatic shadow cast by her wide hood, obscuring her eyes but highlighting the serene, pale curve of her chin and nose.

The atmosphere is charged with anticipation; the air seems to hum with an ancient melody, mingling with the soft crackle of the electrical filaments. The lighting casts a dramatic contralight, accentuating the edges of her silhouette against the dark void, creating a pronounced halo effect. The scene culminates in a moment of poised stillness, as if time has paused, capturing the essence of her arcane mastery and the impending revelation.
