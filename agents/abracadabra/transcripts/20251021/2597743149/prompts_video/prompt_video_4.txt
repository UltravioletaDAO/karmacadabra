**Scene 4 Prompt:**

The scene opens with 0xultravioleta standing tall, centered in the mystical void. The camera, from a slightly upward angle, captures their full silhouette. The orchestral score swells with a subtle urgency, intertwining with the hum of vibrant energy.

As the camera pans slowly from left to right, the luminous circle behind 0xultravioleta's hooded head emits pulsating white-blue rays. These beams arc gracefully, feeding into their open palms. The violet mist intensifies, swirling at their feet, while the dark overshirt dances against the glowing undertunic.

Suddenly, a burst of electric cyan illuminates the runes, casting intricate patterns in the mist. The scene concludes with a gentle fade to black, the orchestral notes lingering in the air, hinting at the profound power yet to unfold.
