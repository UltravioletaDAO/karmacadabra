      "contenido": "In the latest stream titled \"WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS + BLAZE LP + RULETAS?\", Ultravioleta shared a bunch of exciting updates and challenges we've faced as a community. Here's the most important information:\n\n## Community Achievements\n\nFirst, let's celebrate a major achievement: we won the community world championship! It was a close victory, but thanks to our alliances with ETH Cali and Celo Colombia, we demonstrated that, although we are a relatively new community, we have impressive organizational and collaborative power. This victory gives us tremendous momentum and reaffirms our ability to work together and achieve ambitious goals.\n\n## Resource Management and Operation\n\nA proposal was discussed to acquire tickets for the Stream Fighter 4 event. We will use funds from the multisig and, if necessary, sell UVD to cover the difference. Ultravioleta highlighted the need to improve the transaction approval process, suggesting changes in the quorum or the incorporation of more signers to streamline decisions.\n\nAdditionally, we are migrating to a new Safe Wallet interface. This transition is important to keep up with the technological tools we use, and Ultravioleta suggested that, while the update is completed, it would be strategic to place the funds in staking to maximize benefits.\n\n## Blockchain Investments\n\nJoker proposed a joint investment in Blaze-USDC liquidity in Black Hole, with a 50-50 reward sharing model. This investment promises an APY of up to 300%, which could be a smart strategy to generate passive income during bearish market periods.\n\n## Community Conflicts and Solutions\n\nRegarding challenges, we had an issue with roulette refunds that almost destabilized the community. But, as always, Ultravioleta quickly resolved the situation with a massive airdrop of 50 million UVD to compensate those affected. This not only restored trust but also showed our ability to overcome obstacles together.\n\nFinally, a criminal complaint against FIFA's NFT platform on Avalanche was discussed, highlighting the regulatory risks and potential implications for users. This topic is crucial for all of us to be aware of the legal challenges that may arise in our space.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis stream was a reminder that, although we face challenges, we also have great opportunities ahead. From our victories to AI innovations and blockchain investments, we continue to move forward as a community. Let's stay united and keep working together to overcome any obstacles that come our way.",
