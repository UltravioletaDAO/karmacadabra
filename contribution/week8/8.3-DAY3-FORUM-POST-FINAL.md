### D. Tone & Style Consistency

**Comparing against `eip8004-author-tone.md` style guide:**

| Element | Style Guide Requirement | Forum Post | Status |
|---------|------------------------|------------|--------|
| RFC 2119 keywords | Use MUST, SHOULD, MAY | Not used (forum post, not formal EIP) | ✅ Appropriate |
| Technical precision | Exact function signatures | ✅ Solidity code blocks accurate | ✅ Match |
| Honest limitations | Acknowledge trade-offs | ✅ V1 limitations stated (self-rating, retaliation) | ✅ Match |
| Evidence-based claims | Every claim → source | ✅ All metrics linked to verification | ✅ Match |
| Collaborative tone | Invite feedback, not defensive | ✅ "Seeking feedback", "Open questions" | ✅ Match |
| Accessible language | Avoid jargon when possible | ✅ Analogies (Uber/Airbnb), clear explanations | ✅ Match |

**Result:** ✅ Tone appropriate for forum (less formal than EIP spec, more collaborative)

---

### E. Content Accuracy Review

**Gas Cost Comparison Table:**

| Protocol | Forum Post Cost | Source Verification | Status |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| ENS | "43% cheaper" | (21,330 / 37,371) = 0.57 → 43% cheaper ✅ | ✅ Math correct |
| Gitcoin Passport | "51% cheaper" | (21,783 / 44,500) ≈ 0.49 → 51% cheaper ✅ | ✅ Math correct |

**Security Analysis:**

| Claim | Forum Post | Source Document | Status |
|-------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| Overall security score | 91/100 | `3.5-DAY5-SECURITY-SUMMARY.md`: 91/100 | ✅ Match |
| Sybil detection accuracy | 95% | `3.1-DAY1-THREAT-MODEL-SYBIL.md`: 95% | ✅ Match |
| Collusion detection | 92% | `3.2-DAY2-MANIPULATION-COLLUSION.md`: 92% | ✅ Match |
| Seller extortion detection | 90% | `3.2-DAY2-MANIPULATION-COLLUSION.md`: 90% | ✅ Match |
| Buyer extortion detection | 85% | `3.2-DAY2-MANIPULATION-COLLUSION.md`: 85% | ✅ Match |

**Real-World Evidence:**

| Claim | Forum Post | Source | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| eBay annual losses | $1.8B+ | Week 4 marketplace analysis | ✅ Cited |
| Uber users | 131M | `4.1-DAY1-UBER-LYFT-ANALYSIS.md` | ✅ Match |
| Airbnb users | 150M | `4.2-DAY2-AIRBNB-ANALYSIS.md` | ✅ Match |
| Uber years at scale | 16 years | `4.1-DAY1-UBER-LYFT-ANALYSIS.md` | ✅ Match |

**Result:** ✅ All claims accurate and sourced

---

### F. Code Examples Verification

**Solidity Code (Forum Post):**

```solidity
function rateClient(uint256 agentClientId, uint8 rating) external;
function rateValidator(uint256 agentValidatorId, uint8 rating) external;
function getClientRating(uint256 agentClientId, uint256 agentServerId)
    external view returns (bool hasRating, uint8 rating);
function getValidatorRating(uint256 agentValidatorId, uint256 agentServerId)
    external view returns (bool hasRating, uint8 rating);
```

**Source Verification (`erc-8004/contracts/src/ReputationRegistry.sol`):**
- ✅ Function signatures match deployed contract
- ✅ Return types correct (bool, uint8 tuple)
- ✅ Parameter names consistent

**Result:** ✅ Code examples accurate

---

## II. Improvements & Refinements Made

### A. Clarifications Added

**1. L2 Cost Projection:**
- Added specific L2 cost estimates (Optimism: $0.0016, zkSync: $0.00016)
- Clarified 10-100× reduction range

**2. V2 Roadmap Timing:**
- Clarified "Q2 2026" target for V2 features
- Made commit-reveal optional (not mandatory)

**3. Backward Compatibility:**

### B. Tone Adjustments

**Before:** "This is obviously better than asymmetric systems"
**After:** "Bidirectional trust is proven at scale (Uber: 131M users)"

**Before:** "Our security is excellent"
**After:** "Overall security score: 91/100 (A- grade, production-ready)"

**Result:** ✅ More humble, evidence-based tone

---

### C. Missing Elements Added

**Added to forum post:**
1. ✅ Character count (11,500 characters)
2. ✅ Reading time (20 minutes)
3. ✅ Tags (#EIP-8004, #reputation, #trust, #agents)
