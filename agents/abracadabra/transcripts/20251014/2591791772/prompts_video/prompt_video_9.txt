**Scene 9:**

*INT. DIGITAL ABYSS - NIGHT*

We open with a close-up of 0xultravioleta's face, her expression softening, as if an invisible weight is lifted. The soft, silvery glow surrounding her intensifies, creating a halo effect. A subtle, melancholic piano melody begins to play, echoing in the void. The camera gently pulls back, revealing the digital particles now swirling around her in a slow, rhythmic dance, forming abstract shapes that momentarily resemble human faces. As the melody swells, the particles coalesce into a shimmering, translucent archway behind her, symbolizing a path forward. A gentle wind-like whoosh transitions the scene, as the camera tilts upward, focusing on the archway's apex, hinting at new beginnings.
