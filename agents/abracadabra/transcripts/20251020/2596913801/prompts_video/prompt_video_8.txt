**Video Prompt for Scene 8:**

The scene opens with a seamless cut to a close-up of Martin’s fingertips lightly tapping on the holographic interface, their movement leaving trails of luminescent sparks. The interface dissolves to reveal a digital archive, showcasing vibrant thumbnails of his past projects—Bitmex trading bot, Minor Tour app, and more—each animating briefly as if breathing with life.

The camera gently zooms out, capturing Martin’s reflective gaze as the thumbnails orbit around him, casting a soft, pulsating glow. A subtle electronic melody rises, harmonizing with the ambient hum, as the scene transitions with a smooth fade into the next chapter of innovation.
