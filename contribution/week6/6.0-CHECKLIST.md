# Week 6 Checklist: Blog Post & Case Study

**Week 6 Focus:** Public Communication Materials
**Duration:** 20 hours (4 hours per day Ã— 5 days)
**Dates:** October 30 - November 3, 2025
**Objective:** Create accessible documentation for community engagement and EIP submission

---

## Overview

Week 6 transitions from technical documentation (Week 5) to public-facing materials. The goal is to make the bidirectional trust extension understandable and compelling to:
1. **EIP reviewers** (Ethereum Magicians forum community)
2. **Agent developers** (potential adopters)
3. **General blockchain community** (awareness and adoption)

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] **EIP-8004 tone analysis complete** (style guide for consistency)
- [x] **Formal extension document** (plugs 1:1 with original EIP-8004)
- [x] **Blog post published** (~6,800 words, accessible to non-technical readers)
- [x] **Case study published** (~9,500 words, narrative technical tone)
- [ ] **Visual architecture diagram** (system overview for blog post)
- [ ] **Week 6 summary document** (deliverables synthesis)

**Target audience comprehension:**
- Non-technical readers can explain "why bidirectional trust matters"
- Technical readers can implement the protocol from blog post examples
- EIP reviewers can assess formal extension without reading Week 5 specs

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Blog post too technical

**Mitigation:**
- âœ… Use analogies (Uber drivers/passengers, not abstract "clients/servers")
- âœ… Add TL;DR at top
- âœ… Include storytelling (eBay seller quote, darelou bad client)
- âœ… Simplify technical sections (code examples with explanations)

---

### Risk 2: Case study too long (reader fatigue)

**Mitigation:**
- âœ… Add table of contents with anchor links
- âœ… Use visual breaks (tables, code blocks, headers)
- âœ… Make sections skippable (Executive Summary covers key points)
- âœ… Add appendices for detailed data (can skip if not interested)

---

### Risk 3: Formal extension doesn't match EIP-8004 tone

**Mitigation:**
- âœ… Created comprehensive style guide (eip8004-author-tone.md)
- âœ… Followed EIP template structure exactly
- âœ… Used RFC 2119 keywords consistently
- âœ… Maintained problem-first framing
- âœ… Honest limitation acknowledgment (no overclaiming)

---

### Risk 4: Metrics inconsistency across documents

**Validation checklist:**
- [x] 99 transactions cited consistently âœ…
- [x] $1.8B eBay losses cited consistently âœ…
- [x] 131M Uber users cited consistently âœ…
- [x] 21,557 gas cost cited consistently âœ…
- [x] 91/100 security score cited consistently âœ…
- [x] 95% Sybil detection cited consistently âœ…
- [x] 92% collusion detection cited consistently âœ…

- **Code examples:** 15+ (Solidity + Python + JavaScript)
- **Evidence citations:** 25+ (transactions, costs, metrics)
- **Real-world examples:** 10+ (eBay seller, darelou client, Uber/Lyft, etc.)

### Qualitative

- **Accessibility:** Non-technical readers can explain "why bidirectional trust matters"
- **Credibility:** Technical readers trust data/metrics cited
- **Actionability:** Developers can start implementing from blog post examples
- **EIP-readiness:** Formal extension ready for ethereum/EIPs submission

---

## Notes

**Tone Evolution:**
- **Week 5:** Technical specification (EIP reviewers)
- **Week 6:** Accessible communication (broader audience)
- **Week 7-8:** Evidence package and community prep (adoption-focused)

**Audience Segmentation:**
- **Formal extension (6.2):** EIP reviewers, protocol designers
- **Blog post (6.3):** Developers, blockchain community, non-technical readers
- **Case study (6.4):** Researchers, implementers, case study readers

**Cross-References:**
All three documents reference each other and point to Week 1-5 documentation for deep dives.

---

**Status:** ðŸ”„ **83% COMPLETE** (20/24 hours logged)
**Next:** Create visual diagrams + Week 6 summary
**Estimated Completion:** October 30, 2025 (end of day)
