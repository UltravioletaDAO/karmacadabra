The scene opens on a wide shot of a bustling tech office, filled with the soft hum of computers and distant chatter. The camera smoothly pans across desks cluttered with monitors displaying complex server migrations. As it moves, it seamlessly transitions to a close-up of a young, focused engineer, MARTIN, typing furiously on his keyboard. The warm overhead lighting casts a soft glow on his concentrated expression. A subtle electronic soundtrack underscores his meticulous work. 

As MARTIN pauses and leans back, the camera subtly tilts upwards, revealing a wall clock striking 3:00 PM, hinting at the passage of time and the urgency of his task. The scene fades as the camera pulls back to reveal the office's vibrant, collaborative energy, maintaining narrative continuity with the previous scene's focus on server migration challenges.
