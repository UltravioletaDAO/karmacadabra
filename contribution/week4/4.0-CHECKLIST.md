- ‚úÖ Week 3: Security analysis (91/100)

**Blocks:**
- None (all work is documentation and analysis)

**Enables:**
- Week 5: Technical documentation (uses comparison insights)
- Week 6: Blog post (uses positioning from Week 4)

---

## Notes

**Week 4 Approach:**
- Focus on comparative analysis (no code)
- All deliverables are documentation
- Emphasize unique advantages of blockchain + bidirectional
- Build compelling case for EIP contribution

**Key Message:**
"Bidirectional trust is common in Web2 (Uber, Airbnb) but centralized and opaque. EIP-8004 brings trust on-chain but is unidirectional. Our extension combines the best of both: bidirectional accountability + blockchain transparency."
