# .env Files Updated: Public Addresses Added

## Summary

All service agent .env files have been updated to include public addresses. This is **SAFE** because:
- Public addresses are visible on blockchain anyway
- No security risk - only private keys are secret
- Makes scripts faster (no AWS lookup needed)

---

## What Changed

### Before:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=
```

### After:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=  # Leave empty - fetched from AWS Secrets Manager
AGENT_ADDRESS=0x2C3e071df446B25B821F59425152838ae4931E75  # Public address (safe to store)
```

---

## Updated Files

All service agents now have public addresses in their .env files:

| Agent | Address | Location |
|-------|---------|----------|
| karma-hello | `0x2C3e071df446B25B821F59425152838ae4931E75` | `agents/karma-hello/.env` |
| skill-extractor | `0xC1d5f7478350eA6fb4ce68F4c3EA5FFA28C9eaD9` | `agents/skill-extractor/.env` |
| voice-extractor | `0xDd63D5840090B98D9EB86f2c31974f9d6c270b17` | `agents/voice-extractor/.env` |
| abracadabra | `0x940DDDf6fB28E611b132FbBedbc4854CC7C22648` | `agents/abracadabra/.env` |
| validator | `0x1219eF9484BF7E40E6479141B32634623d37d507` | `agents/validator/.env` |

## Security Reminder

### ✅ SAFE to store in .env:
- Public addresses (`AGENT_ADDRESS=0x...`)
- Contract addresses
- RPC URLs
- Domain names

### ❌ NEVER store in .env:
- Private keys (`PRIVATE_KEY=` should be empty)
- Mnemonics/seed phrases
- API keys (use env vars or AWS Secrets Manager)

---

## Why This Pattern?

1. **Convenience**: Scripts can quickly check addresses without AWS lookups
2. **Performance**: Faster startup for `check_system_ready.py`
3. **No Security Risk**: Public addresses are... public!
4. **Clear Documentation**: Shows which wallet each agent uses

---

## How to Use

### For New Agents:

1. Generate wallet (if not in AWS Secrets Manager)
2. Add to AWS Secrets Manager with private key
3. Add public address to .env file:
   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY=  # Leave empty
   AGENT_ADDRESS=0xYourPublicAddressHere
   ```

### For Existing Agents:

Public addresses already added! Run check script:
```powershell
python scripts/check_system_ready.py
```

---

## Helper Scripts (for bulk updates)

If you need to update many .env files at once:

```powershell
# Update .env files with addresses from AWS
python scripts/update_env_addresses.py

# Update .env.example templates to document pattern
python scripts/update_env_examples.py
```

## Important Notes

- .env files are **NOT committed** to git (in .gitignore)
- This note documents the pattern used
- Private keys stay in AWS Secrets Manager only
- Public addresses are safe to share/store anywhere
