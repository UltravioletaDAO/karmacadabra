**Scene 2 Prompt:**

The scene opens with a full-body shot of 0xultravioleta, centered and vertical, standing in an ethereal void. The camera adopts a slightly upward angle, creating an awe-inspiring perspective. The atmosphere is charged with mysticism, enhanced by a volumetric violet and blue mist swirling at their feet. 

As the camera gently circles 0xultravioleta, the lighting shifts to reveal a radiant magical circle hovering behind their head. This circle emits vibrant white-blue rays, sending pulses of energy toward their open, upturned palms. Their layered tunic billows gracefully, the dark overshirt contrasting with the luminous undertunic, creating a hypnotic dance of light and shadow.

A soft orchestral score underpins the scene, punctuated by a distant hum of energy. The camera closes in, capturing the intricate runes within the circle that flicker with an electric cyan glow. In this moment, 0xultravioleta embodies serene control; their face is shadowed by a wide hood, yet their presence radiates authority and wisdom.

The scene concludes with a sudden, dramatic flare of light from the circle, transitioning into a fade-out, seamlessly connecting to the anticipation built in Scene 1.
