*INT. VOID OF MAGIC - NIGHT*

The scene opens with a close-up of a swirling vortex of violet and cyan mist, emanating from the ground as ethereal music sets a mystical tone. The camera pulls back to reveal 0xultravioleta, standing in full figure, centered in the frame with a slightly ascending perspective. She stands tall, arms open in a cross, fingers delicately curved as if weaving energy. A circle of luminous runes floats above her head, casting a halo of light onto the hooded figure, obscuring her eyes in shadow. Lightning filaments arc from the circle to her palms, illuminating the dark void. The scene transitions with a pulse of light, hinting at her control over the unfolding ethereal ritual.
