- **Completeness:** Evidence package covers all assertions
- **Accessibility:** FAQ makes adoption barriers clear

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Metrics inconsistency across weeks

**Mitigation:**
- Create master metrics document (7.1) as single source of truth
- Audit Weeks 1-6 for metric citations
- Update any inconsistencies before Week 8

### Risk 2: Diagrams don't render in Markdown

**Mitigation:**
- Test in multiple Markdown viewers (GitHub, GitLab, VSCode)
- Provide PNG fallbacks for all Mermaid diagrams
- Include diagram source code in appendix

### Risk 3: Evidence package too complex

**Mitigation:**
- Create simple index at top (table of contents)
- Include "Quick Verification" section (top 5 claims in 5 minutes)
- Provide step-by-step verification guide

### Risk 4: FAQ doesn't address key objections

**Mitigation:**
- Review Week 4 comparative analysis (eBay, Uber objections)
- Review Week 3 security analysis (attack objections)
- Anticipate EIP reviewer concerns (backward compatibility, gas costs)

## Notes

**Key Principle:** Week 7 is about **validation and packaging**, not new research.

All metrics, findings, and evidence already exist from Weeks 1-6. Week 7 consolidates, structures, and visualizes for external audiences.

**Deliverable interdependencies:**
- Metrics summary (7.1) feeds into evidence package (7.3)
- Diagrams (7.2) embed in blog post (6.3) and case study (6.4)
- Evidence package (7.3) supports FAQ answers (7.4)
- All deliverables support Phase 3 community engagement

**Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 transition:**
- Phase 2: Create documentation (internal-facing, perfecting the message)
- Phase 3: Share documentation (external-facing, engaging the community)

---

**Status:** ðŸ”„ **0% COMPLETE** (0/20 hours logged)
**Next:** Day 1 - Quantitative metrics summary
**Target Completion:** November 7, 2025
