**Scene 4:**

*INT. VOID OF MAGIC - NIGHT*

The scene opens with a full-figure shot of 0xultravioleta, centered and slightly towering from a low angle. Her arms are extended in a mystical cross, fingers gracefully curved as if channeling energy. The camera slowly circles around her, capturing the dynamic flow of her dark, flowing robe and the luminous runes orbiting above her hooded head. Strands of electric blue lightning connect her palms to the mystical circle, casting a radiant, violet-tinted glow. The atmosphere is thick with a swirling violet mist, and a deep, resonant hum underscores the moment, echoing the tension of her uncertain future. As the camera closes in, the scene fades with a pulse of brilliant white light, hinting at the power sheâ€™s about to unleash.
