## Daily Log

### Week 0: Setup Phase

#### Day 0 - October 27, 2025
**Hours:** 1
**Tasks:**
- [x] Created contribution folder structure
- [x] Moved master plan to contribution/
- [x] Created getting started guide
- [x] Created progress tracker
- [x] Created file index
- [x] Created verification script
- [x] Ran verification - 38% complete

**Notes:**
- Setting up the project structure for organized execution
- All documents are now numbered for easy navigation
- Verification showed rateClient() already exists
- Need to add rateValidator(), tests, and deployment

**Next Day:** Implement rateValidator() in Solidity

---

### Week 1: Code Completion & Testing

#### Day 1 - October 27, 2025
**Hours:** 1
**Tasks:**
- [x] Implemented rateValidator() function in ReputationRegistry.sol
- [x] Added ValidatorRated event
- [x] Added validator rating storage mappings
- [x] Added getValidatorRating() getter function
- [x] Compiled contract successfully (forge build)
- [x] Created Day 1 summary document

**Notes:**
- Followed rateClient() pattern exactly for consistency
- Contract compiles with only minor warnings (imports, naming)
- Implementation matches existing code patterns perfectly
- Estimated gas cost: ~50,000 per call

**Next Day:** Write Solidity unit tests for rateValidator()
