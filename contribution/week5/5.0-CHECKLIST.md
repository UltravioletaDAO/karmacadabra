## Writing Methods

### rateClient()
**Signature:** `function rateClient(uint256 agentClientId, uint8 rating) external`
**Description:** Allows server to rate client quality
**Parameters:**
- `agentClientId` (uint256): Client agent ID
- `rating` (uint8): Rating score 0-100
**Events:** `ClientRated(uint256 indexed clientId, uint256 indexed serverId, uint8 rating)`
**Gas Cost:** ~21,557 gas (Fuji testnet, Week 2 average)
**Errors:**
- `AgentNotFound`: Client ID doesn't exist
- `InvalidRating`: Rating > 100
**Example (Solidity):**
```solidity
contract.rateClient(clientId, 95);
```
**Example (Python):**
```python
tx = contract.functions.rateClient(client_id, 95).transact()
```

### rateValidator()

**Enables:**
- Week 6: Blog post (uses formal spec for technical details)
- Week 13: EIP submission (formal spec is core deliverable)

---

## Notes

**Week 5 Approach:**
- EIP-style specification (follows Ethereum EIP format)
- Developer-first documentation (practical, not just theoretical)
- Code examples mandatory (every method has working code)
- Tested examples (all code examples executed and verified)

**Key Message:**
"Complete technical reference enabling any developer to integrate EIP-8004 bidirectional trust in under 2 hours."
