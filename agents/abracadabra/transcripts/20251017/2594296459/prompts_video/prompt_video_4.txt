**Scene 4: "The Interface Transition"**

The scene opens with a top-down shot, capturing a digital interface projected mid-air before 0xultravioleta. The interface glows with a soft, pulsating blue, casting reflections on their mystic attire. As the camera gently descends, a soft orchestral note harmonizes with the hum of digital energy. Their fingers hover above the interface, interacting with holographic elements that ripple outward like water.

A quick, seamless transition focuses on the interface's transformation, displaying the words "Data Migration Initiated." The interface's colors shift to a deeper indigo, mirroring the room's ambient light. The camera pans to reveal 0xultravioleta's focused profile, illuminated by the interface's glow.

The scene concludes with a subtle zoom out, capturing the mystical circle's runes aligning with the digital interface's patterns, symbolizing the merging of magic and technology. The orchestral score fades into a contemplative note, hinting at the unfolding journey.
