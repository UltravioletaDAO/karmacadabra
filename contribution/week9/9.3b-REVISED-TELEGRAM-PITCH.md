# Revised Telegram Pitch (eBay Correction Applied)

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** READY TO USE (eBay facts corrected)
**Target:** EIP-8004 authors via Telegram/Twitter DM

## Version 1: Full Telegram Pitch (~150 words)

Hey [Author name] üëã

I extended EIP-8004 with bidirectional trust (servers rate clients).

**Problem:** Limited seller feedback enables buyer fraud
- Amazon: No buyer ratings at all
- eBay: Sellers restricted to positive/neutral only (no negative since 2008)
- EIP-8004: Only servers rated ‚Üí inherits similar limitations

**Solution:** Mutual ratings with FULL negative feedback power
- Uber/Airbnb prove it works (131M/150M users)
- Drivers CAN rate passengers negatively ‚Üí prevents abusive riders
- Hosts CAN rate guests negatively ‚Üí prevents property damage

**Evidence:** 99 real blockchain transactions, 91/100 security, $0.016 gas

I've prepared docs (quick ref, formal spec, evidence package) and would love 5 minutes of your feedback on:
1. Commit-reveal (V1 or V2?)
2. Backward compatibility concerns?
3. Extension vs standalone EIP?

**Quick look:** github.com/ultravioletadao/karmacadabra/blob/master/contribution/week7/QUICK-REFERENCE.md

Worth 5 minutes? üôè

## Version 2: Ultra-Short (~50 words)

Extended EIP-8004 with mutual ratings (servers rate clients). Fixes limitation where only servers get rated.

Amazon has NO buyer ratings. eBay can't leave negative feedback (since 2008). Uber/Airbnb prove full bidirectional works (131M/150M users).

99 transactions tested. Docs ready. 5 min feedback?

## Version 3: One-Liner Hook (~20 words)

Built bidirectional trust for EIP-8004. Uber proves it scales (131M). 99 blockchain transactions tested. Worth 5 min review?

## Key Changes from Previous Version

### ‚ùå Removed (Incorrect)
- "$1.8B eBay losses" claim (unverified, conflates cause)
- "eBay sellers can't rate buyers" (factually wrong - they can rate positive/neutral)
- "Asymmetric trust" framing (eBay is partially bidirectional, not fully asymmetric)

### ‚úÖ Added (Accurate)
- "Limited seller feedback power" (more accurate framing)
- Amazon as primary example (truly has NO buyer ratings)
- eBay specifics: "positive/neutral only, no negative since 2008"
- Emphasis on FULL negative feedback power (Uber/Airbnb)
- Clearer contrast: Limited (Amazon/eBay) vs Full (Uber/Airbnb) vs Blockchain (EIP-8004a)

---

## Why This Version is Stronger

### Credibility
- **No unverified claims:** Removed $1.8B figure without source
- **Accurate facts:** eBay policy change (2008) is verifiable
- **Dual examples:** Amazon (no ratings) + eBay (limited ratings) shows spectrum

### Argument Quality
- **Stronger case:** "Even WITH partial ratings (eBay), fraud persists" > "No ratings exist"
- **Clear value prop:** Full negative feedback power (Uber/Airbnb) > limited feedback (eBay)
- **Three-tier comparison:** None (Amazon) ‚Üí Limited (eBay) ‚Üí Full (Uber/Airbnb) ‚Üí Immutable (EIP-8004a)

### Precision
- **Specific policy:** "No negative since 2008" (shows research depth)
- **Clear distinction:** Bidirectionality ‚â† Full accountability (eBay is bidirectional but limited)
- **Emphasizes key difference:** Negative feedback POWER, not just existence of ratings

## Personalization Tips

### For Marco De Rossi (@MarcoMetaMask)
Add: "Curious if MetaMask's reputation systems could integrate EIP-8004a's cross-protocol ratings"

### For Davide Crapis (Ethereum Foundation)
Add: "Would value EF's perspective on bidirectional trust for agent economies"

### For Jordan Ellis (Google)
Add: "Google's experience scaling reputation (YouTube, Maps) relevant here‚Äîdoes commit-reveal make sense?"

### For Erik Reppel (Coinbase)
Add: "Coinbase likely cares about security: 91/100 score, 95% Sybil detection‚Äîany concerns?"

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

### If They Respond Positively
1. Offer 15-30 minute call (prepare call materials from 9.2)
2. Share specific doc link most relevant to their interest:
   - Security-focused ‚Üí Evidence package
   - Implementation-focused ‚Üí Formal extension
   - Quick overview ‚Üí Quick reference
3. Ask specific question (commit-reveal V1/V2, backward compat, extension vs standalone)

### If They Respond Neutrally ("Interesting but busy")
1. Thank them sincerely
2. Ask one focused question: "If you had 1 minute, what's the biggest concern?"
3. Offer to follow up in 2-4 weeks after they review

### If They Don't Respond (7 days)
1. One polite follow-up: "Completely understand if you're swamped. Even a quick 'interesting' or 'not pursuing' helps me know if I should continue down this path."
2. If still no response after 14 days, gracefully move on
3. Continue with broader community engagement (developer outreach, Week 10)

---

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Don't spam:** One message, one follow-up max, then respect their silence
‚ùå **Don't oversell:** "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" sounds hype, not credible
‚ùå **Don't demand time:** "Can we schedule a call?" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Worth 5 min review?"
‚ùå **Don't use attachments:** Link to GitHub, let them click if interested
‚ùå **Don't write walls of text:** Brevity shows respect for their time

---

## Success Metrics

### Positive Response
- They reply with interest ("Tell me more")
- They ask a technical question
- They request call/meeting
- They provide feedback (even critical)

### Neutral Response
- They reply but decline ("Interesting but not pursuing")
- They forward to someone else
- They suggest alternative approach

### No Response (Expected)
- 7+ days silence (they're busy, not obligated)
- Gracefully move on after polite follow-up
- Focus energy on broader community engagement

## Example Personalized Message (Marco)

```
Hey Marco üëã

Saw your work on EIP-8004 and built an extension: bidirectional trust (servers rate clients).

Problem: Limited seller feedback enables abuse
- Amazon: No buyer ratings
- eBay: Positive/neutral only (no negative since 2008)
- EIP-8004: Only servers rated

Solution: Full mutual ratings (Uber/Airbnb model)
- Drivers CAN rate passengers negatively (prevents abuse)
- 131M users prove it scales

Tested: 99 blockchain transactions, 91/100 security

Curious if MetaMask's reputation systems could integrate cross-protocol ratings from EIP-8004a?
