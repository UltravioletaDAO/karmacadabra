**Scene 8:**

*INT. DIGITAL ABYSS - NIGHT*

The scene begins with a rapid dolly shot gliding through the swirling particles that once formed the key, converging back into a singular stream of light leading towards 0xultravioleta. As the camera steadies on her, she stands resolute, bathed in a soft, silvery glow that contrasts the previous violet hues. Her eyes are locked onto the horizon, where a faint silhouette of JULIAN emerges from the void. A tense, electronic beat pulses softly, syncing with her heartbeat. The scene ends with a slow zoom into her unwavering gaze, hinting at the impending confrontation.
