**INT. URBAN APARTMENT - NIGHT**

The camera glides through a dimly lit, cluttered apartment filled with tech gadgets and music equipment, setting a vibrant yet tense atmosphere. Soft, ambient music with a low bass hums in the background. We see a young man, JULIAN, pacing nervously, his face illuminated by the glow of multiple screens displaying charts and messages. The camera smoothly tracks his movements as he pauses, glancing at a blinking notification on his phone. The scene transitions seamlessly with a slow zoom into his phone screen showing a calendar reminder for an upcoming 'Space' event. The ambient music fades, replaced by the subtle sound of distant city traffic.
