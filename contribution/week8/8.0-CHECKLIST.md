# Week 8: Forum Engagement - Checklist

**Phase:** Phase 3 - Community Outreach
**Week:** 8 of 16
**Goal:** Launch community engagement via Ethereum Magicians forum and GitHub
**Date:** October 30, 2025

## Overview

Week 8 kicks off Phase 3 by engaging the Ethereum community through official channels. The goal is to present EIP-8004a extension to the community, gather initial feedback, and establish dialogue with stakeholders.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Engagement
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Tag relevant community members (EIP-8004 authors, reputation system developers)
- Post during high-activity times (weekday mornings US East Coast)
- Cross-post to relevant Discord/Telegram channels (with permission)
- Follow up with direct outreach (Week 9) if forum quiet

### Risk 2: Negative Feedback
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Low (expected, valuable)
**Mitigation:**
- Respond professionally and promptly
- Acknowledge valid concerns, document for iteration
- Don't argue, present evidence and ask for suggestions
- Use FAQ to address common objections

### Risk 3: Technical Objections
**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Evidence package addresses most technical concerns
- Link to formal specification for details
- Offer to schedule calls for deep technical discussions
- Document objections for V2 roadmap

### Risk 4: Timing Issues (Community Busy)
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor Ethereum Magicians for activity level
- If quiet, focus on GitHub issue and direct outreach
- Adjust timeline if major Ethereum events happening (conferences, hard forks)

## Notes

**Philosophy:** This is a conversation, not a presentation. The community's feedback improves the EIP. Approach with humility, curiosity, and evidence.

**Tone:** Professional, collaborative, evidence-based. Avoid marketing language. Let the data speak.

**Response Strategy:** Acknowledge all feedback within 24 hours, even if full answer requires research. "Great question, let me pull the data" > delayed silence.
