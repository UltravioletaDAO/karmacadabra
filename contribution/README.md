## 🎯 Your Mission

**Goal:** Get your bidirectional trust pattern formally accepted into EIP-8004

**What you're contributing:**
- Service providers can rate clients (prevents bad actors)

- Fully backward compatible with EIP-8004

**Impact:**
- Solves reputation asymmetry in agent economies
- Used by Uber, Airbnb for same reason
- Your innovation, formalized in Ethereum standard

- Recommended next steps

### Step 2: Open Week 1 Checklist (NOW!)
```bash
code contribution/week1/1.0-CHECKLIST.md
```

**Today's focus:**
- Read through all Week 1 tasks
- Start with Day 1 tasks
- Goal: Implement `rateValidator()` in Solidity

### Step 3: Start Coding! (2-3 hours)

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Do I have to do all 16 weeks?**
A: Yes, if you want formal EIP acceptance. But the real work is Weeks 1-12. Weeks 13-16 are just paperwork.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A:
1. Check `erc-8004-example/bidirectional/` for reference
2. Read EIP-8004 spec
3. Ask in Ethereum Magicians forum

**Q: Can I skip weeks?**
A: Not recommended. Each week builds on previous weeks. But you can go faster if you have code/docs ready.

**Q: What if the authors say no?**
A: There are 3 paths (see 0-MASTER-PLAN.md):
- Path A: Core integration ✨
- Path B: Separate EIP-8004a ✅
- Path C: Best practice doc 📖
All are wins!

**Q: When should I contact the authors?**
A: **NOT YET!** Wait until Week 9. You need:
- Working code
- 100+ real transactions
- Security analysis
- Documentation
Then you'll have a strong proposal.

**Q: Can I contribute in less time?**
A: Yes! If you work full-time, you can finish in 6 weeks instead of 16. The master plan assumes part-time (15 hrs/week).
