**Video Prompt for Scene 3:**

The scene opens with a close-up of MARTIN's hands, hovering hesitantly over the keyboard, the dim office lights casting shadows that mirror his inner turmoil. The camera tilts up to capture MARTIN's pensive face, his eyes reflecting the digital chaos of the past, narrated over a soft, reflective electronic melody.

As MARTIN recalls his AWS breach, the camera smoothly transitions to a flashback: a rapid montage of server names appearing and disappearing on his screen, each accompanied by a soft whoosh sound. The lighting flickers slightly, mirroring the instability of the memory.

The scene concludes with a focus on MARTIN's determined expression, the dim office now brighter, symbolizing his resolve, as the soft electronic beat fades, leaving a sense of resilience.
