**Scene 5 Prompt:**

The scene opens on a close-up of 0xultravioleta's face, her features partially obscured by the wide hood, eyes closed in deep concentration. The mystical ambiance from the previous scene lingers, the air shimmering with residual energy. The camera pulls back smoothly, revealing her still in the void, arms lowered now, the magical circle behind her dimming slightly but still pulsing with power.

As the camera continues to retract, a soft, warm light begins to illuminate the scene from the bottom, casting gentle, golden hues over 0xultravioleta's dark tunic. The ethereal mist from earlier dissipates slightly, revealing a floating digital interface surrounding her, made of translucent screens displaying images and data: old hard drives, Blackberries, nostalgic browser bookmarks. 

The camera rotates gracefully around her, capturing the harmonious blend of ancient magic and modern technology. Faint whispers of electronic chimes mix with soft, echoing beats, underscoring the unity of past and present.
