**Scene 10: "The Consequence"**

[0:00 - 0:02] **Crossfade from Black**: We open with a close-up of a digital clock on a wall, counting down ominously. The room is bathed in the same red emergency glow, a visual thread from the previous scenes. The rhythmic ticking of the clock underscores the urgency.

[0:02 - 0:04] **Swift Pan and Focus**: The camera swiftly pans to a translucent holographic display in the center of the room, projecting spiraling numbers and graphs, visually echoing the earlier chaotic dashboard. A low, pulsating bass drone heightens tension.

[0:04 - 0:05] **Cut to Wide Shot**: A wide shot reveals a modern office, its sleek surfaces reflecting the red glow. A group of executives stand frozen, eyes locked on the display, their expressions a mix of disbelief and dread.

[0:05 - 0:07] **Slow Zoom and Fade**: The camera begins a slow zoom towards the holographic display, focusing on a rapidly fluctuating line graph. As the numbers erratically spike, the screen flickers, and the scene fades to black, leaving a haunting echo of ticking in the silence.
