**Scene 1:**

*INT. DIMLY LIT APARTMENT - NIGHT*

The camera slowly pans across a cluttered desk, papers strewn with cryptic notes and diagrams. A faint blue glow from a laptop screen flickers, casting shadows across the room. Soft, tense music plays in the background. The lens focuses on a trembling hand clutching a USB stick, knuckles turning white. The camera then tilts up to reveal the protagonist's face, eyes wide with a mix of anxiety and realization. A single tear glistens in the ambient light, capturing the gravity of his mistake. The scene fades to black as the music swells, hinting at the weight of the unresolved conflict.
